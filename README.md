# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice repository! This repository contains Java code implementations for various DSA topics to help you prepare and improve your algorithmic problem-solving skills. You'll find implementations for linear search, binary search, bubble sort, cyclic sort, insertion sort, and various array manipulation operations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/nakulbh/DSA-IN-JAVA.git`, then `cd DSA-IN-JAVA`
2. **Explore the directories:** Navigate through the relevant directories to find the Java code implementations for each DSA topic.

## Usage

- Review the code implementations for each DSA topic to understand the algorithms and logic.
- Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts.
- Test the code with different inputs to see how it behaves in different scenarios.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you spot a bug, have a better solution, or want to add more DSA topics, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
